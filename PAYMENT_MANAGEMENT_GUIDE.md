## 🔄 **How It Works**

### **Current Workflow (After Implementation):**

```
1. School Admin → Generate Invoices → Status: 'unpaid'
2. School Admin → View Reports → See all invoices with action buttons
3. School Admin → Mark as Paid → Set payment date → Confirm
4. System → Update Database → Refresh Statistics → Update UI
5. School Admin → Export Reports → Download updated payment data
```

### **Database Operations:**
```sql
-- Mark single invoice as paid
UPDATE invoices 
SET status = 'paid', 
    paid_date = '2024-01-15',
    updated_at = NOW()
WHERE id = 'invoice_id' AND school_id = 'school_id';

-- Mark multiple invoices as paid
UPDATE invoices 
SET status = 'paid', 
    paid_date = '2024-01-15',
    updated_at = NOW()
WHERE id IN ('invoice_1', 'invoice_2', 'invoice_3') 
AND school_id = 'school_id';
```
