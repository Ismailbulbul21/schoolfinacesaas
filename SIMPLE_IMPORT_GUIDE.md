# Simple Bulk Import Guide

## 🎯 **Much Simpler Now!**

I've simplified the bulk import system to make it much easier to use. Here's what you need to know:

## ✅ **What's Simple Now:**

### 1. **Just Upload & Go**
- Upload your CSV or Excel file
- We automatically find the name and class columns
- No complex column selection needed

### 2. **Easy File Format**
Your file just needs two columns:
- **Student Names** (can be called: Name, Student Name, Full Name, etc.)
- **Class/Grade** (can be called: Class, Grade, Section, etc.)

### 3. **Example File:**
```
Name,Class
Ahmed Hassan,Grade 1

```
